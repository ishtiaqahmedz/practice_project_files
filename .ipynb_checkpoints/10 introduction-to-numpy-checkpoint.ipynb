    "# A Quick Introduction to Numerical Data Manipulation with Python and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html) stands for numerical Python. It's the backbone of all kinds of scientific and numerical computing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since machine learning is all about turning data into numbers and then figuring out the patterns, NumPy often comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/numpy-6-step-ml-framework-tools-numpy-highlight.png\" alt=\"a 6 step machine learning framework along will tools you can use for each step\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do numerical calculations using pure Python. In the beginning, you might think Python is fast but once your data gets large, you'll start to notice slow downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons you use NumPy is because it's fast. Behind the scenes, the code has been optimized to run using C. Which is another programming language, which can do things much faster than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this being behind the scenes is you don't need to know any C to take advantage of it. You can write your numerical computations in Python using NumPy and get the added speed benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your curious as to what causes this speed benefit, it's a process called vectorization. [Vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization) aims to do calculations by avoiding loops as loops can create potential bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy achieves vectorization through a process called [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html#module-numpy.doc.broadcasting).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NOTE:\n",
    "Vectors and matrices are often referred to by the general term arrays. A vector is an array of 1 row x n columns (row vector) or 1 column x n rows (column vector), while a matrix is an array of m rows x n columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Numpy also offers seperate metrices function. Numpy matrices are strictly 2-dimensional, while numpy arrays (ndarrays) are N-dimensional. Matrix objects are a subclass of ndarray, so they inherit all the attributes and methods of ndarrays.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The main advantage of numpy matrices is that they provide a convenient notation for matrix multiplication: if a and b are matrices, then a*b is their matrix product\n",
    "Arrays in Real Life:\n",
    ".In real life, arrays are used whenever items must be put in an orderly manner. One of the easiest examples is a seating chart in theaters or a classroom, which is a 2D array that can be accessed by seat numbers, which are stored in rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this notebook cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy library is very capable. However, learning everything off by heart isn't necessary. Instead, this notebook focuses on the main concepts of NumPy and the `ndarray` datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the `ndarray` datatype as a very flexible array of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we'll look at:\n",
    "* NumPy datatypes & attributes\n",
    "* Creating arrays\n",
    "* Viewing arrays & matrices (indexing)\n",
    "* Manipulating & comparing arrays\n",
    "* Sorting arrays\n",
    "* Use cases (examples of turning things into numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through it, you'll have the base knolwedge of NumPy you need to keep moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I get help?\n",
    "If you get stuck or think of something you'd like to do which this notebook doesn't cover, don't fear!\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since NumPy is very friendly, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
    "    * [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html) - the ground truth for everything NumPy, this resource covers all of the NumPy functionality.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a NumPy function might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"how to find unique elements in a numpy array\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to the NumPy documentation for the `np.uniquie()` function: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 2 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of the functions off by heart to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is continually asking yourself, \"what am I trying to do with the data?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."

    "### Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy operations are usually done on pairs of arrays on an element-by-element basis. In the simplest case, the two arrays must have exactly the same shape.NumPy’s broadcasting rule relaxes this constraint when the arrays’ shapes meet certain constraints. Following are the Numpy broadcasting rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rules of Broadcasting\n",
    "    1. If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
    "    2. If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
    "    3. If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, in order to broadcast, the size of the trailing axes for both arrays in an operation must be either the same size or one of them must be one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of multiplication of a (an array) with scaler value b:\n",
